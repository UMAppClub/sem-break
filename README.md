>**WHY does git matter?** To keep track of changes you make to a project, to keep various versions of your software accessible in future (in case you wanna roll back to a previous version), and to be able to work on the same files with a group of people, without overriding each other's code. It is also a great way to showcase your talent and projects.

**What you'll learn:** concept of git using git in CLI (command line interface)

**What you'll learn:** HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is used to build the layout of website, and CSS is responsible for the styling of the website. If you were building an apartment, the skeleton would be html, the colors, windows, doors, and anything that has to do with apearance would be considered CSS, roughly.




### Steps:

1. Learn HTML/CSS 
    1. Go to [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/map#collapseFront-End-Development-Certification) and take these courses:
        - HTML/CSS
        - (optional) Responsive Design with Bootstrap
        - (optional) jQuery

    2. Alternative learning resource: [Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/html-tutorial)
        
2. Build your one-page personal website 
    - Once you have learned HTML/CSS enough to be able to build a simple layout, build your own website.
    - you can follow "Basic Front End Development Projects" (after learning HTML/CSS) on Free Code Camp if you're not sure where to start.
3. Deploy it to Netlify
