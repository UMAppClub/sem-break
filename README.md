### Learn `Git` 
>🎁 Level: Beginner

>📁 Pre-requisite: *None*

>**WHY does git matter?** To keep track of changes you make to a project, to keep various versions of your software accessible in future (in case you wanna roll back to a previous version), and to be able to work on the same files with a group of people, without overriding each other's code. It is also a great way to showcase your talent and projects.

> **HOW will you *use* git here** For now let's just say you're gonna build a website, push it to github, deploy it to a server so you can view it live at your personal domain!

**What you'll learn:** concept of git, and using git in CLI (command line interface)
