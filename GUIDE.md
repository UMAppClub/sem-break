>Choice of `text editor`: I and almost all developers that I know use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it's light and beautiful.

## 0️⃣ Learn Command Line
>🎁 Level: Beginner

>📁 Pre-requisite: *None*

As a computer science/IT student, knowing how to use `CLI (command line interface)` is a must for us, and it's fairly simple, too, in fact. 

Here's my favorite tutorial for command line (the one I used to learn, in my first year) to get you started, feel free to use t as a cheatsheet for a while if you need:

## 1️⃣ Learn `Git` 
>🎁 Level: Beginner

>📁 Pre-requisite: *None*

>**WHY does git matter?** To keep track of changes you make to a project, to keep various versions of your software accessible in future (in case you wanna roll back to a previous version), and to be able to work on the same files with a group of people, without overriding each other's code. It is also a great way to showcase your talent and projects.

> **HOW will you *use* git here** For now let's just say you're gonna build a website, push it to github, deploy it to a server so you can view it live at your personal domain!

**What you'll learn:** concept of git, and using git in CLI (command line interface)

### Resources:
You can learn git using any of these resources.
* [Git – no deep shit guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [Interactive Git tutorial - GitHub](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
* [Git tutorial on Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/save-your-code-revisions-forever-with-git)
* [Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial)


### assignment: 
* Build an account on GitHub, if you don't have one

## 2️⃣ `Build` your one-page personal website 
>🎁 Level: Beginner

>📁 Pre-requisite: *Git*

**What you'll learn:** HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is used to build the layout of website, and CSS is responsible for the styling of the website. If you were building an apartment, the skeleton would be html, the colors, windows, doors, and anything that has to do with apearance would be considered CSS, roughly.



### Steps:

1. Learn HTML/CSS 
    1. Go to [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/map#collapseFront-End-Development-Certification) and take these courses:
        - HTML/CSS
        - (optional) Responsive Design with Bootstrap
        - (optional) jQuery

    2. Alternative learning resource: [Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/html-tutorial)
        
2. Create a new repository on GitHub. You'll be pushing your code to this repo.
3. Build your one-page personal website 
    - Once you have learned HTML/CSS enough to be able to build a simple layout, build your own website.
    - you can follow "Basic Front End Development Projects" (after learning HTML/CSS) on Free Code Camp if you're not sure where to start.
    - don't forget to commit your code to Github on every major change. Here are [Git best practices, if you're interested](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/)


## 3️⃣ `Deploy` your website to Netlify 

>🎁 Level: Beginner - intermediate (this section requires you to be good at following official documentations for some configuration and potentially troubleshooting the domain propagation or deploy. You'll know more about these later on, in this article)

>📁 Pre-requisite: *Have a Github repository, containing your project's codes*

Briefly, `deploying` a website mean syncing all your site files and configurations with an online server, so people on the web can view your website.

Netlify is a platform that allows you to deploy your code directly and `continuously` from Github. 
>`Continuous deployment` means every time you commit and push new code to the github repo of your website, the live version will be automatically updated with latest changes/

📌 Here's a [step-by-step guide to deploy your website (from Github) to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/).

Now that your website is live and can be viewed by people on some-random-name.netlify.com, let's try to get you a free domain and link your website to it.

## 4️⃣  Get a free `domain` and more with GitHub Education Pack

>💰 This is one of the best online deals we computer science/IT students can get, using our university emails. 

>📁 Pre-requisite: You must have a university email (name@siswamail.um.edu.my will do)

You can use this promo to get a free .me domain for a year, $150 AWS credit (there will be tutorials about this soon), and many many more free stuff!
Get it now: [Github education pack](https://education.github.com/pack). If you need help, see [this official tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-for-a-student-developer-pack/).

Once you claim your GH education pack, redeem the *Namecheap* free domain offer for free and proceed to the next section.

## 5️⃣ Add your custom domain to your netlify project 

>🎁 Level: intermediate. In this section you'll be configuring your newly purchased domain to point to netlify. This step may not be very intuitive at first, feel free to ask for help in App Club community.

Follow the [step-by-step documentations](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/#assigning-a-custom-domain) to configure your domain to point netlify webservers.
